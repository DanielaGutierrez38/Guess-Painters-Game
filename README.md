# Guess-Painters-Game
This is one of my favorite projects:) This is a decision tree based game. The code first reads a csv file (the format must be that the columns are questions, the first row is filled with painter names, and the values on the rows are 1's or 0's based on the answers to the questions). The code is able to build the best and most balanced tree based on the best way to split the answers. Additionally, the csv doesn't need to be painters, it can be any other topic as long as the format is the same as the above mentioned. After the code builds the tree, the game starts. The user is asked a series of yes/no questions, and depending on their answers, the game will try to guess which painter they are thinking of!
